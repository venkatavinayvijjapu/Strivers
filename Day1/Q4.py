# # Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array

# We will run a loop(say i) to iterate the given array.
# Now, while iterating we will add the elements to the sum variable and consider the maximum one.
# If at any point the sum becomes negative we will set the sum to 0 as we are not going to consider it as a part of our answer.
